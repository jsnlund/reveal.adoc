Example of how to use asciidoctor-reveal.js and reveal.js while keeping a clean repository for your presentation.

== Asciidoctor / Ruby / Bundler

Assuming you have Ruby installed and the gem *bundler*.

=== bundle install
bundle instructions on the Asciidoctor reveal.js site use the following command.

[source]
----
bundle config --local github.https true
bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin
----

But based on warnings in the command line when this command is executed, it should actually be of the following form.

[source]
----
bundle config --local github.https true
bundle config set --local path '.bundle/gems'
bundle binstubs --all
----

== Asciidoctor.js / JavaScript (Node.js) / npm

Haven't tried this implementation yet.
Need to setup a different branch for an example repo with that.

== Initialize submodules

[source]
----
git submodule update --init
----


== Compile presentation

[source]
----
bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs PRESENTATION.adoc
----
